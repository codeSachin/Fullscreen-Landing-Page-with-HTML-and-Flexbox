# Fullscreen-Landing-Page-with-HTML-and-Flexbox
Responsive full screen landing page with pure html and css. for practice i also used some flexbox. YO!!

The Trick is using css unit "vh" i.e. viewport height which covers the browser size. 
if we use style="height:100vh" then the whole browser window is covered be it of a mobile phone or a desktop or whatever. 
100vh == full size of the browser screen and it's fully responsive.
